##I worked on a project focused on API Integration and Data Visualization,  The main goal of the task was to fetch real-time or sample data using a public API and convert that data into meaningful visual representations to enhance user understanding and interaction. This project was completed using Python, and the development environment I chose for this project was Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provided a smooth and efficient workflow. For the API integration and visualization, IAlthough the instructions using a public API from OpenWeatherMap,  I created a static dataset that mimics real-world weather data to build the initial structure and flow of the project. The dataset was constructed using the pandas library, and it included temperature data for five major Indian cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Bangalore. Each city was assigned a sample temperature value, and this structured data was stored in a DataFrame, which served as the input for the visualization.
