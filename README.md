##Weather Dashboard with Streamlit & OpenWeatherMap API
This project is a Weather Dashboard built using Python and Streamlit. It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data, and uses Matplotlib for data visualization. The dashboard displays current weather conditions along with mock historical trends for temperature, humidity, and precipitation.

##Features
Fetch real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap
Visualize temperature, humidity, and precipitation trends using Matplotlib
Generate mock historical data based on current weather
Download weather data as a CSV file
Simple and responsive Streamlit UI
Error handling and API key protection using .env file
Caching with @st.cache_data for better performance.
Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit
Matplotlib

pandas
##Run the Weather Dashboard Start the app using Streamlit: streamlit run app.py # replace filename with app.py You should see a new tab open in your browser at http://localhost:8501, showing the weather dashboard.

First copy the path of the app.py, i.e., your saved code location. Then open cmd or Terminal and Enter: cd path of file #Replace your file path then press Enter. Then again type streamlit run app.py #Replace app with your filename then press Enter. You should see a new tab open in your browser at http://localhost:8501, showing the weather dashboard.
