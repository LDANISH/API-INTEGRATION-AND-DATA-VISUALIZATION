Run the Weather Dashboard Start the app using Streamlit: streamlit run app.py # replace filename with app.py You should see a new tab open in your browser at http://localhost:8501, showing the weather dashboard.

First copy the path of the app.py, i.e., your saved code location. Then open cmd or Terminal and Enter: cd path of file #Replace your file path then press Enter. Then again type streamlit run app.py #Replace app with your filename then press Enter. You should see a new tab open in your browser at http://localhost:8501, showing the weather dashboard.
